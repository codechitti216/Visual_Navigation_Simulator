# ViNT Data Logger Improvements Summary

## Issues Addressed

The user reported three critical issues with the original data logger:

1. **Images are inverted** - Images appeared upside down due to OpenGL coordinate system
2. **Images are very small** - 224x224 resolution was too small for detailed navigation  
3. **Wrong camera perspective** - User wanted number plate level view, not cockpit view

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Fixed Image Inversion** ✅
**Problem**: OpenGL framebuffer reads from bottom-left origin, but image files expect top-left origin
**Solution**: Added vertical image flipping in `vint_data_logger.cpp`
```cpp
// Flip image vertically to correct OpenGL coordinate system
cv::flip(image, image, 0);
```

### 2. **Increased Image Resolution** ✅  
**Problem**: 224x224 pixels too small for detailed road navigation
**Solution**: Upgraded to 512x512 pixel resolution
```cpp
static const int VINT_IMAGE_WIDTH = 512;   // Was 224
static const int VINT_IMAGE_HEIGHT = 512;  // Was 224
```
- **5.2x more pixel data** for much better detail
- Better neural network training quality
- Enhanced road feature visibility

### 3. **Number Plate Camera Position** ✅
**Problem**: User wanted camera positioned at number plate level, not driver cockpit view
**Solution**: Modified camera positioning to front bumper area
```cpp
// Position camera at front bumper area, number plate level
p[0] = car->_bonnetPos_x + 1.5;  // 1.5m forward from bonnet
p[1] = car->_bonnetPos_y;        // Same lateral position  
p[2] = car->_bonnetPos_z - 0.8;  // 0.8m lower (number plate height)
```

**Camera Characteristics:**
- **Position**: 1.5m forward of car bonnet, 0.8m lower (number plate level)
- **Height**: Lower road-level perspective like a front bumper cam
- **View**: Clean forward view without any car interior visible
- **Angle**: Looking straight ahead from the number plate area

### 4. **Automatic Camera Switching** ✅
**Problem**: Manual camera switching required
**Solution**: Auto-switch to number plate view when logging enabled
- Press `L` key → Automatically switches to number plate camera
- Press `L` again → Restores original camera view
- Console message: `"ViNT: Switched to number plate camera view (front bumper level)"`

### 5. **Enhanced Debug Output** ✅
Real-time logging feedback shows:
- Frame counter every 100 frames
- Car position, speed, and heading
- Goal waypoints for navigation
- Directory creation status

## Final Result

**Perfect ViNT Training Data:**
- ✅ **High resolution**: 512x512 PNG images  
- ✅ **Proper orientation**: No more upside-down images
- ✅ **Number plate perspective**: Front bumper level road view
- ✅ **Clean dataset**: No car interior, dashboard, or steering wheel
- ✅ **Navigation data**: Synchronized pose and goal waypoints
- ✅ **Easy control**: One-key toggle ('L') for data capture

## Usage Instructions

1. Start TORCS: `/usr/local/bin/torcs`
2. Configure race with Human driver  
3. Start race on any track
4. Press **`L`** to start recording (auto-switches to number plate camera)
5. Drive and collect data
6. Press **`L`** again to stop recording
7. Data saved in `/data/vint_training_logs/[track]/[timestamp]/`

The system now provides exactly the number plate camera perspective requested - a low, forward-mounted view that captures the road from the front bumper level without any car interior visible.
